=======
Options
=======

   -c           Perform case-sensitive searches; by default, searches will try to be greedy
   -h, --help   Show help screen
   -v           By setting verbose output, description lines are allowed to overflow their columns

*NOTES*
Depends on ack-grep (apt-get install ack-grep).
Searches file contents for 'term' instead of just exploit-db vuln summary.
Use any number of search terms you would like (minimum of one).
Search terms are not case sensitive, and order is irrelevant.
